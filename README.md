## Description 
The purpose of this project was to re-write functions to better understand and learn how to use them. This libaray was written to be used on furture C
projects I would be completing throughout the curriculm. libft is the first library I have created and I intend to make improvements to the code and add fucntions as I develop my coding skills and use funtions more consistently.
